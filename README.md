## Week 1:
- In this week, I was introduced to an odd but interesting subject called Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).
- I learned that a proposition is a declarative statement which can be either true (1) or false (0), but cannot be both.
- I've learned the usage, as well as its logical equation, of the following operators/symbols:

| Operator  |  Symbol | Usage | Equation |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | p ⊕ q = (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | p → q = ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | p ↔ q = (p → q) ∧ (q → p) | 
- I knew how to verify a statement by using a Truth Table.
- Also, I've learned the different propositional logic such as:
  - Inverse of p → q: ¬p → ¬q
  - Converse of p → q: q → p
  - Contrapositive of p → q: ¬q → ¬p (which also happens to be the equivalent value of the original statement)

## Week 2:
- If Algebra has a variety of laws and rules in solving mathematical equations, Discrete Mathematics has its own set of laws and rules too. These are called **logical equivalences**. These are as follows:
  - Identity laws
  - Domination laws
  - Negation laws
  - Double Negation law
  - Idempotent laws
  - Commutative laws
  - Associative laws
  - Distributive laws
  - De Morgan's laws
  - Absorption laws
- The idea behind the use of **predicate logic** is comparable to the subject-predicate relationship in English language. We can simplify the proposition or sentence into *subject* and *predicate*.
  - Ex. In the statement "j is equal to 5", the variable 'j' is the subject and the phrase "is equal to 5" is the predicate.
- We were introduced to a new topic: **Quantifiers**. The two types of quantification are the following:
  - *Universal Quantification* - "tells us that a predicate is true for every element under consideration"
  - *Existential Quantification* - "tells us that there is one or more element under consideration for which the predicate is true"
